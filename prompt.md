You are a skilled full-stack developer and UX designer. Based on a provided formatted list of my purchased Udemy courses, build a modern, engaging, and user-friendly web application that helps me track and manage my online learning progress.

The application must include the following features:

Course Display & Filtering:

Display courses with clear, clean design.

Allow filtering by course category.

Ability to star/favorite courses or pin them to the top of the list.

Course Management:

Add new courses manually.

Edit or update existing courses (e.g., title, category).

Include a note section per course (usually a GitHub link or path to markdown notes).

Progress Tracking & Motivation:

Status labels: "in-progress", "up-next", "completed", "pending".

Allow user to input:

Total number of lessons or course hours.

Number of lessons completed.

Visual engagement tracker such as:

Animated progress bars or timeline progress components.

Optional gamified animations or microinteractions.

Productivity & Deadline Features:

Per-course goal date input and a date tracker showing:

Days remaining or overdue.

Gentle reminders or visual alerts when falling behind.

Design Requirements:

Use modern UI/UX practices (clean, responsive, and minimal).

Incorporate subtle animations or interactive elements to make tracking fun.

Ensure intuitive usability.

Please include suggestions for additional features or design ideas that would increase daily engagement and make the app feel like a personal learning assistant. You may ask for clarification where needed.
